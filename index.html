      <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>
    My curiosity and passion for intelligent systems is what drives me
    to explore how we can build efficient tools that make the world a better place.
    Through my academic experiences at Uark, 
    my enthusiasm for computer science, mathematics, and data analysis has grown stronger.
    Over the past few years, I’ve worked across industry, academia, and independent projects, 
    building expertise in system design, applied data analytics, AI integration, and cryptography.
    I’m always interested in projects where mathematics and machine learning intersect;
    projects where theory can be transformed into tools that make a measurable impact.
  </p>
    
  <h2>Research</h2>
  <p>
    My current research focuses on <strong>Drift Detection in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Systems</strong>. 
    The project investigates how AI knowledge bases evolve over time and how these changes affect retrieval and generation quality. 
    The goal is to design a lightweight framework that continuously monitors RAG pipelines to detect "knowledge drift," 
    ensuring outputs remain accurate and reliable even as underlying data changes.
  </p>
  <p>Key objectives include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Building an open-source RAG pipeline using public datasets and pre-trained models to establish a baseline for retrieval and generation.</li>
    <li>Developing drift metrics at both the retrieval and generation levels, including embedding similarity, Recall@K, and semantic consistency between outputs.</li>
    <li>Implementing scripts to track drift over time as documents are added, modified, or removed from the knowledge base.</li>
    <li>Visualizing drift patterns and analyzing trends to highlight potential degradation in AI performance.</li>
    <li>Optionally extending the work with formal modeling and statistical analysis to understand drift dynamics more rigorously.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This research draws on concepts from <em>AI monitoring, knowledge base management, information retrieval,</em> 
    and <em>statistical analysis</em>, combining applied experimentation with opportunities for theoretical exploration. 
    It represents a step toward building AI systems that remain robust, reliable, and contextually aware as they interact with evolving data.
  </p>

  <h2>Projects</h2>
  <p><strong><a href="https://www.camsyncsystems.com/" target="_blank">CamSync File Management System</a></strong></p>
  <p>
    CamSync is my flagship project. This is a file management platform that combines AES-GCM 
    with AI-based document summarization. I built CamSync using Flask, Nginx, and PyTorch-based transformers.
    Every file is encrypted before storage and decrypted only for authorized users.
    The AI summarizer gives user(s) concise and context-aware summaries for multiple file formats
    without needing to open them.
  </p>

  <h2>Vision</h2>
  <p>
    I believe the next generation of intelligent systems must combine strong security guarantees with adaptive, context-aware intelligence. 
    Systems should maintain alignment and fairness over time, learn from interactions responsibly, and safeguard user privacy. 
    My work on CamSync and drift detection research reflects this vision: creating tools that are not only technically robust 
    but also ethically aligned and practically useful.
  </p>

  <h2>Other Activities</h2>
  <p>
    In my free time, 
    I enjoy reading, losing myself in soul, delta blues, and some jazz records.
