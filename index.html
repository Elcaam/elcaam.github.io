  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>
    My curiosity and passion for intelligent systems is what drives me
    to explore how we can build efficient tools that make the world a better place.
    Through my academic experiences at Uark, 
    my enthusiasm for computer science, mathematics, and data analysis has grown stronger.
    Over the past few years, I’ve worked across industry, academia, and independent projects, 
    building expertise in system design, applied data analytics, AI integration, and cryptography.
    I’m always interested in projects where mathematics and machine learning intersect;
    projects where theory can be transformed into tools that make a measurable impact.
</p>
    
  <h2>Research</h2>
  <p>
    My current research focuses on Adaptive Memory Systems for AI, 
    that create architectures that allow intelligent agents to store, prioritize, 
    and retrieve information based on relevance, context, and temporal cues.
  </p>
  <p>The main objectives are to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Develop scoring algorithms that merge recency decay, novelty detection, entropy, and user feedback into a single metric.</li>
    <li>Implement a memory storage: short-term buffers for immediate context, long-term vector databases for semantic recall, and archival layers for compressed, rarely accessed knowledge.</li>
    <li>Integrate AES-GCM so that stored data remains secure without sacrificing the ability to perform intelligent retrieval.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This work draws on research from Neural Turing Machines, Differentiable Neural Computers, 
    continual learning strategies like Elastic Weight Consolidation, 
    and modern memory-augmented large language models. 
  </p>

  <h2>Projects</h2>
  <p><strong>CamSync File Management System</strong></p>
  <p>
    CamSync is my flagship project. This is a file management platform that combines AES-256-GCM encryption 
    with AI based document summarization. I built CamSync using Flask, Nginx, and PyTorch based transformers.
    Every file is encrypted before storage and decrypted only for authorized users.
    The AI summarizer gives user(s) a concise and context-aware summaries for multiple file formats
    without needing to open them. I'm currently looking at how my research can be integrated into CamSync, 
    to enable it to learn from user interaction patterns to improve search accuracy and
    prioritize relevant files.
  </p>
 

  <h2>Vision</h2>
  <p>
    I believe the next generation of intelligent systems
    will need to combine strong security guarantees with adaptive, context-aware intelligence. 
    Data should remain private without becoming inaccessible. 
    These intelligent systems should become more useful the longer they interact with their environment, and 
    I think my work on CamSync and Adaptive Memory Systems is a step towards that.
    future.

  <h2>Other Activities</h2>
  <p>
    In my free time, 
    I enjoy reading, losing myself in soul, delta blues, and some jazz records.
